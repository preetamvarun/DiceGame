# About the Game

It is a simple game where the user taps on a number and clicks on a dice.

# How the game goes

First the user taps on a number and then clicks the die
If both the tapped and die number are equal then the total score becomes the previous score + 2 times the tapped number.

_This functionality is shown below_

If die number and tapped number is not equal then totalscore decreases by 2. If the total score is zero or one then it becomes zero.

If the user clicks the die before tapping the number then a warning box will pop up.

Then there is a reset button which sets the game to start from the beginning.
